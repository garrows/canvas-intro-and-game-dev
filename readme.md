# Intro into Canvas & Multiplayer Web Game Development

This talk starts with the canvas element and teaches how to draw on it. We then add some basic gravity to start building a game. Keyboard input is added. Then we dive really deep by adding realtime multiplayer using WebSockets.

I've given the talk at [CampJS](http://campjs.org) and [BrisJS](http://brisjs.org).
